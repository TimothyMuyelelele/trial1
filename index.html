                I want you to know that you are not insecure. You are confident. You have been created by God in His image and likeness. You have been redeemed by Christ and sealed by the Holy Spirit. You have been chosen and called by God for a special purpose. You have been gifted and equipped by God for good works.

You may not feel it right now, but you have a high value and worth in God's eyes. He loves you unconditionally and infinitely. He knows you intimately and personally. He delights in you and rejoices over you. He accepts you and approves of you.
So please don't let anyone or anything make you feel insecure. Don't let the lies of the enemy or the world deceive you or discourage you. Don't let the comparisons or the criticisms of others diminish you or define you. Don't let the fears or the failures of the past haunt you or hinder you.
Instead, believe in God and His promises. <i>He says in Psalm 139:14, "I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well."

You are a wonderful person, and I'm so proud of you. I'm always here for you, and I'm always praying for you. You are not insecure, you are confident. You are not weak, you are strong. You are not hopeless, you are hopeful.

            If you are reading this I want you to know that you are not lonely. You are loved. You have a heavenly Father who knows you by name and loves you with an everlasting love. You have a Savior who died for you and lives for you. You have a Spirit who dwells in you and comforts you. You have a family of God who welcomes you and supports you.

            You may not feel it right now, but you have a divine presence and a human connection that can fill your heart and soul. God is always with you and He will never leave you nor forsake you. He is always listening to your prayers and He will always answer them. He is always working for your good and He will always fulfill His promises.
            
            So please don't let loneliness overwhelm you. Don't let the enemy isolate you or deceive you. Don't let the world distract you or discourage you. Don't let the circumstances define you or limit you.
            
            Instead, draw near to God and He will draw near to you. <i>He says in Psalm 34:18, "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit."

            You are near to God and He is near to you. You are saved by God and He is rejoicing over you. You are quieted by God and He is singing over you. You can find peace and joy in His presence. You can find hope and strength in His love. You can find comfort and healing in His grace.

            But I want you to know that you are not alone in this. God is with you and He loves you. He created you and He cares for you. He knows your thoughts and He hears your prayers. He gives you peace and He grants you sleep.
            
            So please don't let worry or stress keep you awake. Don't let the problems or pressures of life rob you of your rest. Don't let the fears or doubts of the enemy disturb you or distract you.
            
            Instead, trust in God and His promises. <i> He says in Psalm 4:8, "In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, LORD, make me dwell in safety."[^1^][1] He also says in Matthew 11:28, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."[^2^][2]</i>
            
            You can lie down and sleep in peace, for God alone makes you dwell in safety. You can come to Him, all you who are weary and burdened, and He will give you rest. You can find comfort and joy in His presence. You can find hope and strength in His love. You can find healing and renewal in His grace.
